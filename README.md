### What's in this project?

Hey, glad you found us. Weâ€™ve set out on the noble quest to make a compiler for the mountains of homework our fearless leader Leon assigns us. Though daunting, our goal is to set up a discord bot that finds all the assignments and places them in an environment where they are easy to access and less formidable to keep track of. Along the way we had several additional ideas that would make fun additions to our little project, a button that lets you know when Leon is live, a space for links that can be a little hard to get your hands on and much more.
